# RUST TEST

Making a simple guessing game to try out the langauge. Taken from `https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch02-00-guessing-game-tutorial.html` for more information.

Some tips for initializing and running rust code:
1. cargo new <project name>; edit the files in /src/
2. cargo check //wont execute the binary, but will compile to check
3. cargo run // will compile and run it
4. cargo build // will just compile it (see it under /target/debug/)
